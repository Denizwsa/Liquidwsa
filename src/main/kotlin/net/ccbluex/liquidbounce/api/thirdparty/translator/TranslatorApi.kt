/**
 * Interface for a translation API that translates text from one language to another.
 * The implementation provides two methods: `translate` and `translateInternal`.
 *
 * The `translate` method is the entry point, which is a public method that automatically detects the source language
 * (unless specified) and translates the input text into a target language. The `translateInternal` method is the
 * lower-level internal logic that handles the actual translation work.
 *
 * The API ensures that the provided text is not empty before attempting to perform the translation.
